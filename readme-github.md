This project is about the Traveling Salesman Problem: 

The problem : 
We play the roles of a voyager that has to visit the most interessting touristic places in 3 weeks and come back home.

Goal : find the optimal path, to visit the optimal places, regardless of the starting point
Trajectory Score : 
- 1 Unesco site visited = 10 points 
- a different country visited = 20 points
- each sites "in danger" give +30 points
Final goal is to get the most point in 3 weeks.
Additional info : - We traveled at 85 km/h & stay 7h at each touristic sites.

How to run the project:
write in your terminal :  ./main 'latitude coord' 'longitude coord of your starting point' 
Example =  ./main 48.8464111 2.3548468


The strategy :
